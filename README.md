iOS_Twitter_Data_Visualizer
=================================

Finish Data: March 2013

iOS App. Built a data visualizer for Twitter, based on the location of the most recent tweets that have geolocation information. Twitter framework, Social Framework, MapKit, Core Location framework and Grand Central Dispatch(GCD) are usrd. It get the most recent tweets within 200 mile radius of the user¡¯s current location(defaut location is Columbia University) and display it on a map. Network requests sent asynchronously.

The app will continuously poll for new tweets, and display them on the map when they are received. If the user taps on one of the pins, a small view should display some information about the tweet, and a button to take them to a separate view that displays more information about the tweet (user¡¯s twitter handle, the tweet¡¯s text, timestamp, user's avatar, etc.). On this separate view, the user have the option of favoriting or retweeting that particular tweet.
